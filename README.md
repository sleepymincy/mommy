# mommy - affirmations in your terminal üíû

![screenshot](https://github.com/sleepymincy/sleepymincy/blob/main/.gitfiles/repos/images/mommy.png)

Clearly inspired by by [Gankra/cargo-mommy](<https://github.com/Gankra/cargo-mommy>) and original (in Bash) [sudofox/shell-mommy](<https://github.com/sudofox/shell-mommy>).

After using Bash  implementation for a bit, I've decided to try writing my own implementation in Rust for the sake of learning new things. ~~In the process I think I got too far lost in the cult of Rust.~~

## How to build:
- Get [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- `git clone https://github.com/sleepymincy/mommy`
- `cd mommy`
- `cargo build` or `cargo build -r` for release version (recommended)
- Compiled binary will be in `./target/release/`

## Easy install:
- Get [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- `cargo install shell-mommy`

## Configuration:
Available environment variables: 
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_EMOTES` - to set the emotes to anything u want
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_LITTLE` - to set the petnames mommy is using towards u
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_ROLES` - to change mommy to daddy or whatever else
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_PRONOUNS` - to change mommy's pronouns
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_COLOR` - to change text color
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_STYLE` - to change text style
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_COLOR_RGB` - to set custom rgb color for the text
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_ALIASES` - provide path to your aliases file for mommy to source
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_AFFIRMATIONS` - provide a path to a valid `.json` file, formatted exactly like [assets/affirmations.json](https://github.com/sleepymincy/mommy/blob/master/assets/affirmations.json), otherwise the code will fall back to built-in default affirmations
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_NEEDY` - can be `1`, or `0` (default), decides if mommy is running at all times or only when u call her
- `SHELL_MOMMY_ONLY_NEGATIVE` - can be `1` or `0` (default), decides if mommy only talks when exit code is not 0

You can either specify environment variables every time you run mommy:
```ansi
you@archbtw:~$ SHELL_MOMMYS_COLOR="blue" SHELL_MOMMYS_STYLE="bold" mommy ls -l
drwxr-xr-x - you 20 April 04:20 üìÅ dir1
drwxr-xr-x - you 20 April 04:20 üìÅ dir2
drwxr-xr-x - you 20 April 04:20 üìÅ dir3
you're doing so well~! üíì <- will be blue and bold
```

Or all add this to your `.bashrc` (or any other rc file) to customize it user wide, for example:
```sh
export SHELL_MOMMYS_PRONOUNS="his"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_ROLES="daddy"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_LITTLE="discord kitten/kitty"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_EMOTES="ü§§/üíï/ü•∫/üíã"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_COLOR="blue/red" # Will be randomly rotated between blue and red colors.
export SHELL_MOMMYS_STYLE="bold,italic/bold" # Will be randomly rotated between bold italic style and just bold style.
export SHELL_MOMMYS_COLOR_RGB="255,164,243/255,50,50" # Will be randomly rotated between lilac and red colors in this example. Note, that this setting will overwrite SHELL_MOMMYS_COLOR !!!
export SHELL_MOMMYS_ALIASES="$HOME/.config/aliases"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_AFFIRMATIONS="$HOME/.config/affirmations.json"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_NEEDY=1 # Will make mommy run ALWAYS.
export SHELL_MOMMY_ONLY_NEGATIVE=1 # Will make mommy only print affirmations if exit code is not 0
```

When you set `SHELL_MOMMYS_NEEDY` variable to `1`, mommy will accept exit codes instead of commands as an argument. Examples: 
- `sjdfhsdjkfhsdf; mommy $?` <- returns exit code `127`, which will result in negative response from mommy
- `ls; mommy $?` <- returns exit code `0`, which will make mommy give a positive response

To make this behavior consistent, you can add these to your relevant rc files:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
export PROMPT_COMMAND="mommy \$?; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
```

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
precmd() { mommy $? }
```

```bash
# Others (not tested)
export PS1="\$(mommy \$?)$PS1"
```

You can also change `affirmations.json` before building, or load your own with `SHELL_MOMMYS_AFFIRMATIONS` during runtime, to un-degenerate this piece of software or make it worse. I'm not the one to judge.
