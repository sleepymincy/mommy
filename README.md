# mommy - affirmations in your terminal ðŸ’ž

Clearly inspired by by [cargo-mommy](<https://github.com/Gankra/cargo-mommy>) and original (in Bash) [shell-mommy](<https://github.com/sudofox/shell-mommy>).

After using Bash  implementation for a bit, I've decided to try writing my own implementation in Rust for the sake of learning new things. ~~In the process I think I got too far lost in the cult of Rust.~~

## How to build:
- Get [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- `git clone https://github.com/sleepymincy/mommy`
- `cd mommy`
- `cargo build` or `cargo build -r` for release version

## Easy install:
... TODO: fuck really hard with crates.io~ <3

## Configuration:
Available environment variables: 
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_EMOTES` - to set the emotes to anything u want
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_LITTLE` - to set the petnames mommy is using towards u
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_ROLES` - to change mommy to daddy or whatever else
- `SHELL_MOMMYS_PRONOUNS` - to change mommy's pronouns

You can all add this to your `.bashrc` (or any other rc file) to customize it system wide, for example:
```
export SHELL_MOMMYS_PRONOUNS="his"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_ROLES="daddy"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_LITTLE="discord kitten/kitty"
export SHELL_MOMMYS_EMOTES="ðŸ¤¤/ðŸ’•/ðŸ¥º/ðŸ’‹"
```

You can also change `affirmations.json` file to un-degenerate this piece of software or make it worse by changing default affirmations. 
I'm not the one to judge.

## Known bugs / limitations:
- Crashes whenever command was piped ;
- Is not compatible with Bash aliases (open for suggestions how to fix this) ;
- Probably way more. I'm stupid :3
